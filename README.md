CrackingTheCodingInterview
==========================

<p>This repo contains solutions to sections:</p>
  <ol>
  <li>Arrays and Strings (complete) - java</li>
  <li>Linked Lists (complete) - c++</li>
  <li>Stacks and Queues (complete) - c++</li>
  <li>Trees and Graphs (4.1) - c++</li>
  <li>Recursion (complete) - c++</li>
  <li>Sorting and Searching (9.1, 9.2, 9.3) - c++<br>
    - This file also has an implementation of:<br>
      - Bubble Sort<br>
      - Selection Sort<br>
      - Merge Sort<br>
      - Quick Sort<br>
      - Bucket Sort<br>
  </li>
  </ol>
      
<p>Note that I am not claiming any of these solutions are optimal, and I know that many of them are not. They were just my attempts to come up with a working solution under interview conditions as practice. I am completely open to suggesions on how to improve any and all of these functions.</p>
