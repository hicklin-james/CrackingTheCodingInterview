==========================

<p>This repo contains solutions to the following sections of Gayle Laakmann <i>Cracking the Coding Interview, 4th Edition</i></p>
  <ol>
  <li>Arrays and Strings (complete) - java</li>
  <li>Linked Lists (complete) - c++</li>
  <li>Stacks and Queues (complete) - c++</li>
  <li>Trees and Graphs (4.1) - c++</li>
  <li>Recursion (complete) - c++</li>
  <li>Sorting and Searching (9.1, 9.2, 9.3) - c++<br>
    - This file also has an implementation of:<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Bubble Sort<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Selection Sort<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Merge Sort<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Quick Sort<br>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;- Bucket Sort<br>
  </li>
  </ol>
      
<p>Note that I am not claiming any of these solutions are optimal, and I know that many of them are not. They were just my attempts to come up with a working solution under interview conditions as practice. I am completely open to suggesions on how to improve any and all of these functions.</p>
